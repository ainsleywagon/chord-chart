Chord chart is an experiment in mixing sounds and colors.

We are using Raphael for the animations and Howler.js for the sound.

The impetus is a spirit of basic music education with an interest in generating visuals that match the atmosphere of the chord created. 

In other words, we want to demonstrate how building a chord works mechanically and then ice the cake with beautiful visuals. Because music + great visuals is heaven.
